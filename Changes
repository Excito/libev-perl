Revision history for Perl extension EV

Changes marked with (libev) are changes in libev, and have more
documentation in the libev Changes file.

4.03 Tue Jan 11 14:51:05 CET 2011
	- do not avoid the clock_gettime call on GNU/Linux anymore, as EV
          links against -lpthread anyways - as a result, EV might now take
          advantage of fast userspace clock_gettime implementations,
          but also links against -lrt.
        - (libev) lots of event port bug workarounds.
        - (libev) officially support files in I/O watchers.
        - (libev) new function ev_feed_signal.
        - fix documentation parts still refering to the 3.x API.

4.02 Thu Dec 30 08:27:41 CET 2010
        - the revents argument did not stringify correctly, as only the
          numeric value was updated, while the string value was kept from
          previous invocations.

4.01 Sun Dec  5 12:42:13 CET 2010
	- fully support EV_COMPAT3=0.
        - default_fork was stupidly defined as inline.
        - ask cpan to upgrade AnyEvent if < 5.29.
        - support EV_EXTRA_DEFS during configuration.
        - support -DEV_NO_LOOPS for snakker build.

4.00 Mon Oct 25 13:30:09 CEST 2010
	- many API changes, see the manual.
        - (libev) lots and lots of bugfixes, see the ev documentation.
	- fix a bug where inotify usage would parse the same event
          multiple times, causing various forms of breakage.
	- greatly reduce stack usage for inotify (8kb to <0.5kb).
        - expose ev_depth and ev_verify via the XS API.
        - implement ev_cleanup watchers.
        - (libev) ev_embed_stop did not correctly stop the watcher.
        - (libev) disable poll backend on AIX.
        - (libev) rename EV_TIMEOUT to EV_TIMER.
        - (libev) add section on accept() problems to the manpage.
        - (libev) no child watchers on win32.
        - make code more aliasing compliant, in case perl is ever
          translated to C.
        - document the EV::CHECK runtime unavailability.
        - ported to minix 3.1.7.

3.9  Thu Dec 31 07:59:59 CET 2009
	- disable t/07* under automatic testing.
        - increase t/09* timeouts as netbsd has *horribly* broken
          select/kevent that *usually* sleep >>0.6s instead of 0.3.
        - add constants EV::FLAG_NOSIGFD, EV::FLAG_NOINOTIFY and
          EV::BACKEND_ALL.
        - (libev) signalfd is no longer used by default.
	- (libev) backport inotify code to C89.
        - (libev) inotify file descriptors could leak into child processes.
        - (libev) ev_stat watchers could keep an errornous extra ref on the loop.
        - (libev) take advantage of inotify_init1, if available.
        - (libev) the signal handling pipe wasn't always initialised under windows.
        - changed minimum glibc requirement from glibc 2.9 to 2.7, for signalfd.
        - (libev) only replace ev_stat.prev when we detect an actual difference.

3.8  Sun Aug  9 15:30:10 CEST 2009
	- implement $loop->signal/signal_ns.
        - (libev) incompatible change: do not necessarily reset signal
          handler to SIG_DFL when a sighandler is stopped.
        - (libev) ev_default_destroy did not properly free or zero some
          members, potentially causing crashes and memory corruption on
          repated ev_default_destroy/ev_default_loop calls.
	- (libev) take advantage of signalfd on GNU/Linux systems.
        - (libev) document that the signal mask might be in an unspecified
          state when using libev's signal handling.
        - (libev) take advantage of some GNU/Linux calls to set
          cloexec/nonblock on fd creation, to avoid race conditions.
        - implement internal glue code to interface more efficiently
          with AnyEvent.

3.7  Fri Jul 17 16:49:16 CEST 2009
	- add EV::loop_verify and EV::loop_depth.
        - use output filehandle for i/o watchers waiting
          for EV_WRITE, otherwise input filehandle.
        - use common schmorp.h header.
        - add EV::Timer->remaining.
        - allow for subclassing of EV::Loop (see the exciting
          EV::Loop::Async module for an example).
        - added EV::invoke_pending and EV::pending_count.

        - (libev) ev_unloop and ev_loop wrongly used a global variable to
          exit loops, instead of using a per-loop variable.
	- (libev) the ev_set_io_collect_interval interpretation has changed.
        - add new functionality: EV::invoke_pending, EV::pending_count.
        - add $timer->remaining.
        - add EV::loop_depth.
        - (libev) calling unloop in fork/prepare watchers will no longer poll
          for new events.
        - (libev) use GetSystemTimeAsFileTime instead of _timeb on windows,
          for slightly higher accuracy.
        - (libev) actually 0-initialise struct sigaction when installing
          signals.

3.6  Tue Apr 28 02:50:37 CEST 2009
	- keepalive(0) could decrease the refcount of the loop
          permanently.
        - add ev_suspend/ev_resume, also make ev_now_update
          accessible via the XS API.
        - most EV::<eventtype> constants were missing and have been
          added :/.
        - add EV::VERSION_MAJOR/VERSION_MINOR constants.
        - (libev) multiple timers becoming ready within an event loop
          iteration will be invoked in the "correct" order now.
        - (libev) do not leave the event loop early just because we have
          no active watchers, fixing a problem when embedding a kqueue
          loop that has active kernel events but no registered watchers
          (reported by blacksand blacksand).
        - (libev) correctly zero the idx values for arrays, so destroying
          and reinitialising the default loop actually works (patch by
          Malek Hadj-Ali).
        - (libev) new EV::CUSTOM revents flag for use by applications.
        - (libev) add documentation section about priorites.
        - (libev) add a glossary to the dcoumentation.
        - (libev) extend the ev_fork description slightly.
        - (libev) optimize a jump out of call_pending.
        - t/03_keepalive could fail when there was no actual error.

3.53 Sun Feb 15 02:38:20 CET 2009
	- (libev) on win32, the event loop creation could randomly fail
          due to an initialised variable having the wrong value.
        - (libev) probe for CLOCK_REALTIME support at runtime as well and
          fall back to gettimeofday if there is an error, to support older
          operating systems with newer header files/libraries.
        - prefer gettimeofday over clock_gettime by default.

3.52 Wed Jan  7 21:46:14 CET 2009
	- (libev) fix some issues in the select backend when in fd_set mode.
        - (libev) due to a thinko, instead of disabling everything but
          select on the borked OS X platform, everything but select was
          allowed (reported by Emanuele Giaquinta).
        - (libev) actually verify that local and remote port are matching in
          libev's socketpair emulation, which makes denial-of-service
          attacks harder (but not impossible - it's windows). Make sure
          it even works under vista, which thinks that getpeer/sockname
          should return fantasy port numbers.

3.51 Wed Dec 24 23:01:59 CET 2008
        - do not cache the arguments passed to callbacks if the refcount
          indicates that the callback has stolen them.
	- (libev) try to avoid librt on GNU/Linux.
        - (libev) check port_getn return value dfferently, might potentially
          avoid problems.
        - (libev) fix a bug with stat watchers possibly causing freezes.
        - (libev) work around OS X 10.5 breaking poll, now select is the
          only viable choice left on that pile of garbage.
	- play tester whore: disable some tests that typically fail only
          on cpan tester machines.

3.49 Wed Nov 19 11:26:53 CET 2008
        - fix typos in manpage (Alex Efros).
	- increase timing even further, for the ever-overloaded cpan-tester
          machines, and to the detriment of everybody else who wants a fast
          make test.
        - possible 5.6 compatibility.
        - (libev) use inotify even on buggy kernels, but don't rely on it.
        - (libev) use inotify only as an added hint on network filesystems.

3.48 Thu Oct 30 09:09:48 CET 2008
	- (libev) use a generation counter to detect spurious epoll events
          and recreate the kernel in such a case (sorry, it's slow, but
          I didn't design epoll...).
	- (libev) optimise away an EPOLL_CTL_ADD/MOD combo in the epoll
          backend in some cases.
        - (libev) use memset to initialise most arrays now and do away
          with the init functions.
        - speed up event callback invocation further (~15%), by
          not creating the object reference each time.
        - EV::sleep was documented, but not implemented. fun.

3.45 Tue Oct 21 22:20:39 CEST 2008
	- (libev) disable inotify usage on linux <2.6.25 (kernel bug).
	- (libev) ev_embed will now automatically follow fork.
        - (libev) ev_once will now pass both io and timeout events to
          the callback when both happen concurrently, instead of giving
          one precedence.
	- install C library documentation as EV::libev manpage (sorry, oesi).
        - (libev) fix a minor performance bug in ev_stat handling.

3.44 Mon Sep 29 05:16:31 CEST 2008
	- (libev) add EV::now_update and $loop->now_update.

3.431 Sun Jul 13 00:19:02 CEST 2008
	- made the EV::embed callback optional again. reported by
          Vladimir Timofeev.

3.43 Tue Jul  8 20:56:31 CEST 2008
	- disabled warnings in EV.pm, the CHECK issue is now understood
          and harmless.

3.42 Mon May 26 07:36:46 CEST 2008
	- (libev) work around another bug in windows perls and
           windows itself: failed connects do NOT set read or write
           flags in select, but this version of libev will.

3.41 Thu May 22 01:39:40 CEST 2008
	- (libev) fix many heap-related bugs (timers, periodics).
        - (libev) improve timing stability of timers and periodics.
        - expose ev_loop_verify to perl code.
        - clarify documentation for periodic reschedule callbacks.
        - verify that the passed callback argument is indeed a code
          reference, for earlier error reporting and a nice calling
          speed increase (as well as saving memory).

3.4  Tue May 20 21:51:55 CEST 2008
        - (libev) work around both a windows bug and a bug in perl's
          select on windows when not waiting for any file descriptors.
	- bundle ev.pod into the tarball, just to increase its size
          (and for the poor internetless person).
          
3.33 Sun May 18 12:43:04 CEST 2008
	- (libev) use numerous enhancements such as a more
          cache-friendly 4-heap and heap index caching for timers.
        - remove undocumented ev_timer->at accessor.

3.31 Wed Apr 16 20:48:59 CEST 2008

        - (libev) ev_loop flags are now local to each invocation.

3.1  Sat Mar  8 11:41:14 CET 2008
	- add ev_sync_* and ev_fork_* to EVAPI.h.
	- provide EV::Embed->sweep method.
	- new watcher type: async (not very useful in perl).

3.0  Mon Jan 28 13:23:11 CET 2008
	- upgrade to libev-3.0.
        - change child handler to incorporate tracing flag.

2.01 Mon Dec 31 01:59:19 CET 2007
	- found a minor problem in the testsuite that is only
          caught by new Test::Harness versions (reported by Andreas
          König).

2.0  Sat Dec 22 17:47:03 CET 2007

          on more systems (as its now by default not used on most).
	- expose fork watchers.
        - switch to libev's MULTIPLICITY API.
        - use a slightly different include file name strategy.
        - get rid of (unused) libevent emulation.
        - 5% watcher management speedup due to callback optimisation
          when inline closures are used, 5% slowdown due to multiplicity.
        - very minimal support for dynamic event loops and embed watchers.

          avoids EPOLL_CTL_DEL calls if possible.
	- EV::signal->start was not async-signal safe.
        - optimise start/stop when the fd hasn't changed.

1.8  Tue Dec 11 22:17:46 CET 2007
	- API version 3:0.
	- reduced fudge factor to zero for select, poll, epoll
          and kqueue: your system better be posix-compliant
          even in its extensions :->
        - improve long-term numerical stability in periodic watchers
          by introducing a separate offset value instead of reusing at.
        - recalculate real/monotonic clocks before blocking fully
          to avoid blocking for longer than necessary.

1.3  Sun Nov 25 10:46:57 CET 2007
	- stopping idle/check/prepare watchers could cause data corruption.
	- implement and document EV::once.
        - improved documentation, verify that netbsd indeed has the only

        - expose ref/unref in form of the ->keepalive method to perl.
        - minor bugfixes and portability fixes.

1.2  Thu Nov 22 05:44:09 CET 2007
        - disable kqueue by default on !netbsd, as its broken on freebsd,
          darwin and openbsd and thus almost everywhere.
        - add some allowance in t/01_timer.t for the uneven monotonic
          vs. realtime clock tick on at least freebsd.
        - add -lsocket -lnsl on solaris in case the perl guy forgot to
